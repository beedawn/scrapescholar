To run the SQL tests and initialize the database you must install PostgreSQL, then once it is running run the following:
```bash
CREATE USER student WITH PASSWORD 'student';
CREATE DATABASE scrapescholartestdb;
GRANT ALL PRIVLEDGES ON DATABASE scrapescholartestdb to student;
```

then to initialize the tables navigate to the backend folder and run
```python
python -m app.init_db
```
